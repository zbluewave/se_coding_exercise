# StreetEasy Naughty Neighborhoods

An application to search 3-1-1 complaints in NYC.


## Introduction

The StreetEasy product and data teams have been hard at work coming up with new ideas for useful features -  and would like to start tracking 3-1-1 complaints across NYC. One of the interns has started writing an application to do this, but unfortunately hasn't been able to finish and the code could use some improvement.

You need to help finish the application!


## Requirements

1. _Import the NYC data_. In the `db/nyc_data` directory you'll find `.json` files containing all the data your application needs. Note that because other teams also use these files directly, you (or your code) shouldn't modify these files, instead import them into the database and deal with bad data appropriately.

2. There is a simple user interface that has been built that allows the user to search by a combination of street name, complaint type, complaint status and ZIP. The results should be displayed via an AJAX call and should display in the table below the search bar. This form isn't finished and doesn't work. Implement the logic to do this using the data you imported in the previous step.


## Instructions

1. Using the application in this repository as a starting point, complete according to the requirements above. Feel free to use any additional third party libraries that you'd like.

2. Make any assumptions that you need to. The data is messy and the problem domain tricky - we'd like to see how you approach more complex choices and the trade-offs you make.

3. If necessary, please include any instructions for getting your app up and running locally in an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file in the project root directory.

4. We are evaluating solutions based on the architecture and quality of the code. Show us just how beautiful, clean and pragmatic your code can be.

5. We love testing. Hint, hint ;)

6. Once you're done, open a pull request with your changes.


Now it's time to sit back, relax, maybe put your headphones on and enjoy!
